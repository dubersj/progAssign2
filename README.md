Operating Systems - Programming Assignment 2

I'm a bit rusty at programming in general, but this project does what it is supposed to do. The custom formatted data file supports a 15 number allocation and max matrix, and a 3 number availability matrix, in that order. The numbers are read in one at a time, stored in a vector, and then the values are popped to variables used to initilize the matricies. The banker's algorithm general solution modified slightly from an online version then finds the appropriate safe sequence, and prints it.

Here is an example of the program compiling and running to find the safe sequence for the matricies given:
